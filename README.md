Pint OS Coursework

This is a mini operating system written using C.
We extended the basic operating system that was provided to us, implementing features including sophisticated scheduling 
algorithm, e.g. multi-level feedback queues and a simple pre-emptive system, support for user system calls, 
management of virtual memory as well as memory-mapped I/O (completely from scratch). 
Our resulting system was free from memory leaks and handled failures gracefully.

An Intellij Plugin for the language is also created.
